# Full Project Plan

## Phase 1: Setup Integration Test
*   **Goal:** Create a simple Spring Boot project as an integration test to demonstrate the problem (false positives from `mvn dependency:analyze`) before implementing the solution.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  [completed] Generate a simple Spring Boot project inside `src/it/test-project`.
    2.  [completed] Modify the main `pom.xml` to include `maven-invoker-plugin` to run `mvn dependency:analyze` on the `test-project`.
    3.  [completed] Add an assertion script (`verify.groovy`) to the integration test to check for the presence of false positives.
    4.  [completed] Run the integration test (`mvn clean verify`) and confirm that the test fails as expected.

## Phase 2: Create and Link Empty Analyzer
*   **Goal:** Create an empty `StarterAwareDependencyAnalyzer` class, wire it into the build process, and confirm it's invoked by the integration test.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  [completed] Add necessary Maven API dependencies (`maven-dependency-analyzer`, `maven-core`) with `'provided'` scope to the main `pom.xml`.
    2.  [completed] Create an empty `StarterAwareDependencyAnalyzer` class that extends `DefaultProjectDependencyAnalyzer`.
    3.  [completed] Add `components.xml` to declare `StarterAwareDependencyAnalyzer` as a Plexus component.
    4.  [completed] Configure the `maven-dependency-plugin` in the `test-project`'s `pom.xml` to use the custom analyzer.
    5.  [completed] Execute the integration test and confirm that the custom analyzer is invoked.

## Phase 3: Implement Custom Analyzer Logic
*   **Goal:** Develop the `StarterAwareDependencyAnalyzer` to correctly identify and filter starter-related false positives.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  [completed] Implement the `analyze` method in `io.github.shitikanth.dependencyanalyzer.StarterAwareDependencyAnalyzer` to filter false positives.

## Phase 4: Verify and Finalize
*   **Goal:** Run the integration tests and confirm that the custom analyzer eliminates the false positives.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  [completed] Run the integration test (`mvn verify`) and confirm that it passes.
    2.  [completed] Iterate and refine the analyzer logic or configuration until all requirements are met.
    3.  [completed] Commit the final changes.
