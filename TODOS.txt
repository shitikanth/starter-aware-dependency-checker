# Full Project Plan

## Phase 1: Setup Integration Test (Current Focus)
*   **Goal:** Create a simple Spring Boot project as an integration test to demonstrate the problem (false positives from `mvn dependency:analyze`) before implementing the solution.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  [completed] Generate a simple Spring Boot project inside `src/it/test-project` (TO BE DONE BY USER - DO NOT DO THIS YOURSELF! JUST PAUSE AND WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION.).
    2.  [completed] Modify the main `pom.xml` to include `maven-invoker-plugin` to run `mvn dependency:analyze` on the `test-project` during the `integration-test` phase.
    3.  [completed] Add an assertion to the integration test that reads the logs to validate that no false positives are reported.
    4.  [completed] Run the integration test (`mvn clean verify`) and confirm that the test is failing.

## Phase 2: Empty StarterAwareDependencyAnalyzer + linking with Integration Test
*   **Goal:** Create an empty `StarterAwareDependencyAnalyzer` class and link it with the integration test project to ensure that the analyzer is properly invoked during the build.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  [pending] Create an empty `StarterAwareDependencyAnalyzer` class that simply extends `DefaultProjectDependencyAnalyzer`
    2.  [pending] Configure the test setup to use this analyzer instead of the default one.
    3.  [pending] Execute the integration test (`mvn clean verify`) and confirm that the analyzer is invoked. The tests should of course still fail.

## Phase 3: Implement StarterAwareDependencyAnalyzer
*   **Goal:** Develop the `StarterAwareDependencyAnalyzer` to correctly identify and filter starter-related false positives.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  [pending] Add necessary Maven API dependencies (e.g., `maven-dependency-analyzer`, `maven-core`, `maven-project`) with `'provided'` scope to the main `pom.xml`.
    2.  [pending] Find stable versions for these Maven API dependencies.
    3.  [pending] Implement `io.github.shitikanth.dependencyanalyzer.StarterAwareDependencyAnalyzer`.

## Phase 4: Verify and Refine
*   **Goal:** Run the integration tests and confirm that the custom analyzer eliminates the false positives.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  [pending] Execute the integration test (`mvn clean verify`).
    2.  [pending] Parse the output of `mvn dependency:analyze` from the `test-project` to ensure no false positives are reported.
    3.  [pending] Iterate and refine the `StarterAwareDependencyAnalyzer` logic or `pom.xml` configurations until all requirements are met.
